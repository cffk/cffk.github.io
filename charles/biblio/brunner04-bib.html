                  system that includes a protein and a plurality of
                  different fragment types in order to identify drug
                  leads is presented.  The basis of the method is a
                  weighted Metropolis Monte Carlo approach for sampling
                  the grand canonical ensemble.  This method
                  distinguishes itself from an energy minimization
                  approach in that it provides fragment distributions
                  which are consistent with thermal fluctuations at
                  physiologically relevant temperatures.  The weighted
                  Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme performs a quasi-uniform
                  sampling of all regions of interest on the protein,
                  and, in this way, enables to resolve the wide range in
                  densities of the thermodynamic distribution which
                  could not be achieved by a non-weighted Metropolis
                  scheme.  Making use of the properties of the grand
                  canonical ensemble, the affinity of fragments for
                  different regions on the protein surface can be
                  efficiently computed, using a so-called
                  &amp;ldquo;simulated annealing of the chemical
                  potential&amp;rdquo; process.  A protein binding site is
                  then identified as a region with high affinity for
                  multiple fragments with a diverse set of
                  physico-chemical properties.  Within a binding site,
                  assembly of fragments into drug leads is finally
                  carried out based on binding affinity of the different
                  fragments, on geometric proximity, and a variety of
                  rules by which organic fragments may bond together.},
