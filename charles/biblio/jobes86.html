<strong>Abstract</strong>
<blockquote>
Lower hybrid waves have been used on the PLT tokamak both to start the plasma current and to ramp it up from pre-existing levels. The waves, at 800 MHz, were launched from a 6-waveguide grill. The phasing between adjacent guides could be selected electronically, and thus the launched spectrum could be set and changed at will. For start-up, the waveguide phase difference was initially set at 0&deg; in order to create a plasma, then switched to 90&deg; to drive the current. Over 100 kA of plasma current, at a density of 0.5&ndash;1 &times; 10<sup><small>12</small></sup> cm<sup><small>&minus;3</small></sup>, was generated in this manner. Ramp-up experiments were performed under a wide variety of conditions. The most efficient ramp-up was found at the lowest plasma densities and with the fastest launched spectrum (<i>n</i><sub><small><i>e</i></small></sub> &sim; 2 &times; 10<sup><small>12</small></sup> cm<sup><small>&minus;3</small></sup>, N<sub><small>||</small></sub> &sim; 1.6 peak); &sim; 20% of the launched RF power was converted to (increased) poloidal field energy. All of the ramp-up results are in excellent agreement with a theory which determines the efficiency of ramp-up from the consideration of the relative energy losses of the superthermal current-carrying electrons to collisions and to the opposing inductive <i>E</i>-field.
