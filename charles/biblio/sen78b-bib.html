  abstract =     {Self-modulation effects can become important for the
                  propagation of lower hybrid waves in plasma,
                  particularly for the high power levels envisioned in
                  r.f.  heating schemes.  Earlier studies in two
                  dimensions (in the plane defined by the electric field
                  of the pump wave and the background magnetic field)
                  have led to non-linear propagation equations, such as
                  the MKdV or the non-linear Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equations,
                  which admit multiple-soliton solutions.  These could
                  physically manifest themselves by breaking up the
                  resonance cones into filaments with intense localized
                  electric fields and could further lead to localized
                  heating.  This problem is studied in three dimensions
                  with the motivation of including two additional
                  physical factors.  First, the non-linear effect
                  arising from the &lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt; &amp;times; &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; motion of
                  electrons is included; this leads to an enhancement in
                  the threshold value for the formation of solitons.
                  Secondly, the stability of the two-dimensional
                  solitons to perturbations in the third dimension is
                  studied, and it is found that the third dimension
                  introduces additional dispersive effects which render
                  the solitons unstable to these perturbations.}
