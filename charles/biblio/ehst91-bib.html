  abstract =     {A functional form is presented for the efficiency of
                  current drive in toroidal geometry with waves at
                  frequencies below the electron cyclotron frequency.
                  By fitting constants in order to duplicate numerical
                  results for the efficiency we obtain an accurate
                  function which will be useful for computer
                  calculations of current drive.}
