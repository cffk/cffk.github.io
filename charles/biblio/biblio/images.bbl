  1974.}{Nonlinear excitation of ion waves by a pump near the lower hybrid
  frequency is examined. The ion waves considered are ion acoustic,
  electrostatic ion cyclotron and magnetosonic waves. The approach adopted is
  coupling of modes carried out to second order. We examine the effects of
  varying the angles of the excited waves, and apply the results to excitation
  of such waves in a bounded inhomogeneous plasma. The plasma is assumed
  uniform and is described by the two fluid equations. Considerable complexity
  is introduced by taking the angles of propagation to be arbitrary (subject to
  frequency and wave number matching conditions), and by taking the magnetic
  field to be finite. In order to treat this problem analytically, we have made
  extensive use of MACSYMA, a large symbolic computation system, that has been
  developed by the Mathlab group at M.I.T. Using this facility we have been
  able to obtain approximate analytic results for the growth rates of the
  excited waves. Using damping rates from kinetic theory, thresholds for these
  interactions have been calculated, for typical tokamak plasmas. With the
  interaction in a uniform plasma well understood, we have tried to examine
  some of the effects of exciting the pump from a waveguide at the wall of an
  inhomogeneous plasma. We find that in tokamak plasmas it is possible to
  excite electrostatic ion cyclotron waves, but since the pump ray is very
  narrow unstable pulses are unable to grow significantly before convecting out
  of the pump region. However if it is possible to set up an array of
  waveguides at the boundary of the plasma, a larger region of pump fields is
  attainable, and strong excitation of the electrostatic ion cyclotron wave
  should take place with reasonable external rf powers.}{thesis74}{}{Charles

  nonlinear interaction of ions in a plasma with waves excited by RF power near
  the lower hybrid frequency is considered. The object of this study is to
  evaluate such an interaction as a method of heating the ions in a tokamak.
  The problem is simplified by assuming the magnetic field,
  <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, to be uniform and the lower hybrid wave (whose
  frequency, &omega;, is much greater than the ion cyclotron frequency,
  &Omega;<sub><i>i</i></sub>&nbsp;) to be propagating perpendicular to the
  magnetic field. It is shown that trapping by the wave significantly increases
  the energy of the ions on a time scale of a few cyclotron periods. For longer
  times the motion in a certain region of velocity space becomes stochastic for
  fields satisfying <i>E</i>/<i>B</i><sub>0</sub> &gt;
  &frac14;(&Omega;<sub><i>i</i></sub>&nbsp;/&omega;)<sup>1/3</sup>&omega;/<i>k%

  trapping to an upper limit which scales as <i>E</i><sup>2/3</sup>. The
  stochasticity condition is independent of how close &omega; is to a cyclotron
  harmonic. These results are extended to the case of propagation at an oblique

  It is shown that stochastic ion heating can be an efficient method for
  supplementary heating of the ions in a tokamak.}{thesis77}{}{Charles F.~F.

  shape of the electron distribution by measuring the dependence of the X-ray
  emission on the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight. The

  peaked in the forward direction, although a small fraction of the electrons
  is in the backward cone. The energy dependence of the X-ray spectra is
  consistent with that of a velocity distribution which has a plateau extending
  out to several hundred kilo-electron volts. Radial profiles show that the hot
  electrons are located in the central plasma region and form a high
  conductivity plasma with the current profile frozen in. The slope of the
  spectrum depends on the rf power and on the phasing of the waveguide grill,
  but not on the externally applied plasma voltage. Relaxation oscillations
  occur shortly after switching the rf off. They also appear during the rf for
  low rf power and at the high density limit of the lower hybrid current drive.
  The X-ray spectra confirm that parallel energy is transferred to
  perpendicular energy during the instability, suggesting an instability due to
  the anomalous Doppler effect.}{}{}{Schweickhard~E. von Goeler, James~E.

  reported. The plasma current was first raised to 200&ndash;300 kA by the
  Ohmic heating transformer, and the current in the transformer primary circuit
  was then held constant to remove the OH drive. After the current fell below
  200 kA, up to 300 kW of toroidally-directed RF power at 800 MHz was
  transmitted into the PLT plasma via a 6-element phased waveguide array.
  Current ramp-up rates between 0 and 120 kA/s for a 0.35 s time interval

  conversion ratio should depend on a variety of factors, including the
  percentage of RF power absorbed by resonant electrons and the magnitude of
  the back current induced by the changing poloidal flux <i>LI</i>. The high
  ramp-up efficiencies are predicted theoretically in the regime in which the
  PLT ramp-up experiments operate, i.e., where the phase velocity of the waves
  is approximately equal in magnitude to the runaway velocity due to the back
  voltage. Comparison of the raw data with theory suggest that about &frac12;

  attractive tokamak reactor, and in the successful achievement of the mission
  of ITER, is the development of an efficient steady-state current drive
  technique. Fast waves in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies hold the
  promise to drive steady-state currents with the required efficiency and to
  effectively heat the plasma to ignition. Advantages over other heating and
  current drive techniques include low cost per watt and the ability to
  penetrate to the center of high-density plasmas. The primary issues that must
  be resolved are:<br> 1. Can an antenna be designed to radiate the required
  spectrum of waves and have adequate coupling properties?<br> 2. Will the RF
  power be efficiently absorbed by electrons in the desired velocity range
  without unacceptable parasitic damping by fuel ions or &alpha; particles?<br>
  3. What will the efficiency of current drive be when toroidal effects such as
  trapped particles are included?<br> 4. Can a practical RF system be designed
  and integrated into the device?<br> We have addressed these issues by
  performing extensive calculations with ORION, a 2-D code, and the ray tracing
  code RAYS, which calculates wave propagation, absorption and current drive in
  tokamak geometry, and with RIP, a 2-D code that self-consistently calculates
  current drive and MHD equilibrium. An important figure of merit in this
  context is the integrated, normalized current drive efficiency, &gamma; =
  (<i>n</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>&nbsp;/10<sup>20</sup>m<sup>-3</sup>)<i>I</i><su%

  is the average electron density, <i>I</i><sub>RF</sub> is the total RF driven
  current, and <i>P</i><sub>RF</sub>is the RF power required. The calculations
  that we present here emphasize the ITER device. We consider (1) a
  low-frequency scenario (<i>f</i> &sim; 17 MHz) such that no ion resonances
  appear in the machine, and (2) a high-frequency scenario (<i>f</i> &sim;
  51&ndash;59 MHz) such that the deuterium second harmonic resonance is just
  outside the plasma and the tritium second harmonic is in the plasma, midway
  between the magnetic axis and the inside edge. In both cases electron
  currents are driven by combined TTMP and Landau damping of the fast waves. We
  find that fast waves are quite competitive with other current drive
  techniques.}{}{}{Donald~B. Batchelor, Richard~C. Goldfinger, E.~Frederick

  of the critical components in a tokamak reactor. It must absorb the
  &alpha;-particle power and particle flux and any auxiliary heating power; it
  must permit the removal of the helium ash so that the hydrogen fuel in not
  diluted. The major constraints on the operation of the divertor are that it
  should not result in a large flux of impurities into the plasma and that the
  divertor plate should not erode too quickly. In order to satisfy the last
  constraint, it is necessary to reduce the temperature of the plasma striking
  the plate to far below the temperature at the last closed flux surface;
  otherwise the erosion rate in quasi-steady operation for a machine such as
  ITER is meters per year.<br> Neutrals play a pivotal role in the divertor. In
  the steady state, the flux of ions onto the plate is approximately balanced
  by an outflow of neutrals. In addition, in a &ldquo;high-recycling&rdquo;
  divertor a given ion strikes the divertor plate, is neutralized, flows back
  towards the plasma, is ionized, and swept back to the divertor plate hundreds
  of times before the particle is pumped away. This results in a high neutral
  density and a lower temperature in front of the divertor plate. Other ways of
  reducing the erosion rate are also being investigated: for example, in the
  &ldquo;gas target&rdquo; divertor, the plasma flows into a gas cell and a
  high-<i>Z</i> element radiates away much of the power. In such a divertor,
  neutrals also play a central role.<br> In order to model a divertor it is
  therefore necessary to describe the plasma and the neutrals, the various
  reactions between them (ionization, recombination, charge exchange,
  dissociation, etc.), and their interaction with the divertor plate and other
  material surfaces.<br> In this paper, I address the issue of modeling the
  transport of the neutrals. The goals of such modeling are to provide reliable
  measures of the neutral transport in a divertor for coupling to a plasma
  code, the evaluation of erosion rates, impurities influx, etc., and the
  evaluation of diagnostic quantities, e.g., the line integrated radiation, for
  calibration against experimental measurements.}{}{}{Charles F.~F. Karney}

  applications in tokamak reactors. These applications include on or off axis
  electron heating and current drive [1] and the channeling of alpha particle
  power for both current drive and increased reactivity [2]. Efficient mode
  conversion electron heating with a low field side antenna, with both on and
  off axis power deposition, has been demonstrated for the first time in TFTR
  in D-<sup>3</sup>He-<sup>4</sup>He plasmas. Up to 80\% of the Ion Cyclotron
  Range of Frequency (ICRF) power is coupled to electrons at the mode
  conversion surface. Experiments during deuterium and tritium neutral beam
  injection (NBI) indicate that good mode conversion efficiency can be
  maintained during NBI if sufficient <sup>3</sup>He is present. No evidence of
  strong alpha particle heating by the IBW is seen. Recent modelling indicates
  that if the mode converted IBW is preferentially excited off the horizontal
  midplane then the resultant high poloidal mode number wave may channel alpha
  particle power to either electrons or ions [2]. In TFTR both the propagation
  of the IBW and its effect on the alpha particle population is being
  investigated. Experiments with 2 MW of ICRF power launched with &plusmn;
  90&deg; antenna phasing for current drive show that electron heating and
  sawtooth activity depend strongly on the direction of the launched wave. The

  and pumping from both sides of the private flux region (BPP) in the JT-60U W
  shaped divertor, and between JT-60U IPP and pumping in the DIII-D lower
  baffled divertor. The pumping flux for BPP is smaller than that for IPP by
  about a factor of 2 with weak in-out asymmetry of recycling neutral flux and
  by a factor of 3.5&ndash;6.5 with strong in-out asymmetry. The reduction of
  the pumping flux for BPP is consistent with Monte Carlo simulations, where
  backflow at the outer pumping slot is observed due to in-out recycling
  asymmetry. The pumping flux in DIII-D at <i>I</i><sub><i>p</i></sub> = 0.8 MA

  product for modeling a system that includes a protein and a plurality of
  different fragment types in order to identify drug leads is presented. The
  basis of the method is a weighted Metropolis Monte Carlo approach for
  sampling the grand canonical ensemble. This method distinguishes itself from
  an energy minimization approach in that it provides fragment distributions
  which are consistent with thermal fluctuations at physiologically relevant
  temperatures. The weighted Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme performs a
  quasi-uniform sampling of all regions of interest on the protein, and, in
  this way, enables to resolve the wide range in densities of the thermodynamic
  distribution which could not be achieved by a non-weighted Metropolis scheme.
  Making use of the properties of the grand canonical ensemble, the affinity of
  fragments for different regions on the protein surface can be efficiently
  computed, using a so-called &ldquo;simulated annealing of the chemical
  potential&rdquo; process. A protein binding site is then identified as a
  region with high affinity for multiple fragments with a diverse set of
  physico-chemical properties. Within a binding site, assembly of fragments
  into drug leads is finally carried out based on binding affinity of the
  different fragments, on geometric proximity, and a variety of rules by which
  organic fragments may bond together.}{US20040267456}{}{Stephan Brunner,
