  abstract =     {The divertor is one of the critical components in a
                  tokamak reactor.  It must absorb the &amp;alpha;-particle
                  power and particle flux and any auxiliary heating
                  power; it must permit the removal of the helium ash so
                  that the hydrogen fuel in not diluted.  The major
                  constraints on the operation of the divertor are that
                  it should not result in a large flux of impurities
                  into the plasma and that the divertor plate should not
                  erode too quickly. In order to satisfy the last
                  constraint, it is necessary to reduce the temperature
                  of the plasma striking the plate to far below the
                  temperature at the last closed flux surface; otherwise
                  the erosion rate in quasi-steady operation for a
                  machine such as ITER is meters per year.&lt;br&gt; Neutrals
                  play a pivotal role in the divertor.  In the steady
                  state, the flux of ions onto the plate is
                  approximately balanced by an outflow of neutrals.  In
                  addition, in a &amp;ldquo;high-recycling&amp;rdquo; divertor a
                  given ion strikes the divertor plate, is neutralized,
                  flows back towards the plasma, is ionized, and swept
                  back to the divertor plate hundreds of times before
                  the particle is pumped away.  This results in a high
                  neutral density and a lower temperature in front of
                  the divertor plate.  Other ways of reducing the
                  erosion rate are also being investigated: for example,
                  in the &amp;ldquo;gas target&amp;rdquo; divertor, the plasma
                  flows into a gas cell and a high-&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt; element
                  radiates away much of the power.  In such a divertor,
                  neutrals also play a central role.&lt;br&gt; In order to
                  model a divertor it is therefore necessary to describe
                  the plasma and the neutrals, the various reactions
                  between them (ionization, recombination, charge
                  exchange, dissociation, etc.), and their interaction
                  with the divertor plate and other material
                  surfaces.&lt;br&gt; In this paper, I address the issue of
                  modeling the transport of the neutrals.  The goals of
                  such modeling are to provide reliable measures of the
                  neutral transport in a divertor for coupling to a
                  plasma code, the evaluation of erosion rates,
                  impurities influx, etc., and the evaluation of
                  diagnostic quantities, e.g., the line integrated
                  radiation, for calibration against experimental
                  measurements.}
