  abstract =     {An algorithm for sampling exactly from the normal
                  distribution is given.  The algorithm reads some
                  number of uniformly distributed random digits in a
                  given base and generates an initial portion of the
                  representation of a normal deviate in the same base.
                  Thereafter, uniform random digits are copied directly
                  into the representation of the normal deviate.  Thus,
                  in contrast to existing methods, it is possible to
                  generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any
                  precision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the
                  precision.  The method performs no arbitrary precision
                  arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions, and,
                  indeed, uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever;
                  it uses only simple integer operations.  The algorithm
                  is inspired by von Neumann's algorithm for sampling
                  from the exponential distribution; an improvement to
                  von Neumann's algorithm is also given.}
