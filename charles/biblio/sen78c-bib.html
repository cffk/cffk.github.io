                  wave due to the parametric excitation of quasi-modes

                  plasmas.},
  oabstract =    {We study the effect of parametric excitation of
                  quasimodes on the depletion of a lower hybrid pump
                  wave driven from a finite extent source with
                  parameters relevant to tokamak plasmas.  The set of
                  coupled nonlinear equations for the pump wave and the
                  sideband mode reduces to those corresponding to the
                  three eave resonant equations with one wave heavily
                  damped.  Exact two-dimensional analytic solutions of
                  these equations are investigated in detail to
                  elucidate the effects of the pump width and the
                  convective losses arising out of the finite group
                  velocities of the modes.  We also study the scaling of
                  depletion with variation in plasma parameters.}
