  abstract =     {A theory for the generation of current in a toroidal
                  plasma by radio-frequency waves is presented.  The
                  effect of an opposing electric field is included,
                  allowing the case of time varying currents to be
                  studied.  The key quantities that characterize this
                  regime are identified and numerically calculated.
                  Circuit equations suitable for use in ray-tracing and
                  transport codes are given.}
