A high-quality, fast, portable, parallel random number library.

This is based on techniques described in

D. E. Knuth, Art of Computer Programming (3rd edition, Addison-Wesley,
1998), Vol. 2, Seminumerical Algorithms, Chapter 3, Random Numbers.

The library routines are in the directory src.

Test programs are in the directory test.

Documentation is in the directory doc.

VERSION contains the version number.

All the files are contained in the tar files (ending in .tar) and in the
compressed tar files (ending in .tar.gz).

Note that these routines are currently written for f77 and so are suitable
of both f77 and f90 codes.  The user interface could be substantially
improved in an f90-only world.  In particular the state of the RNG could be
held in a single structure and there could be a single generic interface
for scalars and arrays in both single and double precision.
