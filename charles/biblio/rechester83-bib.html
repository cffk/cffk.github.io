  abstract =     {A review of recent analytical and numerical results
                  concerning the Chirikov-Taylor model is given.  It is
                  shown that the presence of noise makes the statistical
                  description of this system unique.  The form of the
                  diffusion coefficient is quite different depending on
                  the nature of the dynamical orbits (integrable,
                  stochastic, or accelerator).  We have found that in
                  the presence of noise, dynamical averaging, performed
                  numerically, and statistical averaging, performed
                  analytically with the path-integral method, are the
                  same.  Some unsolved problems are presented and
                  discussed.}
