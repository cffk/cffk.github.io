Two sample programs are included.  Both are built with 'make all'.  You
will need to use the GNU version of make.  (On the Crays, do 'module load
GNU'.  On other machines, you may have to invoke it as 'gmake'.)

(1) testrandom.  This should be run and the results checked.  Please tell
me if the answers don't match.

(2) pirandom.  This requires MPI and provides a realistic example of using
random numbers in a parallel application.  Run with, for example,

    mpriun -np 4 ./pirandom

This assumes the existence of the f90 intrinsic date_and_time.  If this
doesn't exist, then initialize the time array or the seed some other way.

There are also targets testrandom-hiprec and pirandom-hiprec with built
with 'make hiprec'.  These are suitable for machines such as the Crays with
real floating point numbers are represented by 64 bits.

Other make arguments you might need:

Sun

    make FFLAGS=-fast

Alpha

    make FFLAGS=-O3

Linux with NAG f90

    make FC=f90 MPIFC=mpif90 FFLAGS=-O

T3E

    make FC=f90 MPIFC=f90 COPTS=-b FFLAGS=-O hiprec

SGI

    make FC=f90 MPIFC=f90 MPILIBS=-lmpi FFLAGS=-O
