<strong>Abstract</strong>
<blockquote>
The equations describing the nonlinear propagation of waves in an anisotropic plasma are rarely exactly soluble. However it is often possible to make approximations that reduce the exact equations into a simple equation. In this paper we will describe how MACSYMA may be used to make such approximations, and so reduce the equation describing lower hybrid waves into the nonlinear Schr&ouml;dinger equation which is soluble by the inverse scattering method. It should be pointed out here that we have not used MACSYMA to do the whole problem; rather MACSYMA is used at several stages in the calculation that are otherwise done by hand. This is not to say that MACSYMA could not do the whole problem, just that there is a natural division between calculations what are easiest done by hand, and those that are easiest done by machine.
