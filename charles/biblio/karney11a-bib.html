  abstract =     {Implementations of two algorithms for the transverse
                  Mercator projection are described; these achieve
                  accuracies close to machine precision. One is based on
                  the exact equations of Thompson and Lee and the other
                  uses an extension of Krueger's series for the
                  projection to higher order. The exact method provides
                  an accuracy of 9 nm over the entire ellipsoid, while
                  the errors in the series method are less than 5 nm
                  within 3900 km of the central meridian. In each case,
                  the meridian convergence and scale are also computed
                  with similar accuracy. The speed of the series method
                  is competitive with other less accurate algorithms and
                  the exact method is about 5 times slower.
