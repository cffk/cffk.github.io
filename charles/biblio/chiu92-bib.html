  abstract =     {Fast wave current drive (FWCD) is a principal
                  candidate for non-inductive current drive schemes in
                  reactors.  Major experiments are in progress or
                  planned on DIII-D, JET, and Tore-Supra.  A theory for
                  FWCD was presented by two of the authors and
                  collaborators.  To minimize computations required in
                  transport simulations, and for analytical
                  understanding, it is very useful to have a concise
                  analytical efficiency formula.  Fisch and Karney, and
                  Ehst and Karney have obtained empirical formulae that
                  fit numerical results for the Landau limit and
                  Alfv&amp;eacute;n limit (low frequency limit);  the latter
                  fits results at 1 &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;le; 2.
                  This paper extends a previous numerical study on FWCD
                  at arbitrary frequencies and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.
                  Analytical formulae for FWCD efficiency, valid for all
                  frequencies and &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, are derived
                  using the adjoint technique in high and low phase
                  velocity regions.  A smooth patching between the two
                  regimes produces an analytical formula which is
                  accurate for all frequencies, &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;,
                  and phase velocities.  Comparison with existing
                  results will be discussed.  A corollary of the present
                  calculation is that at low phase velocities and in the
                  Landau limit, the efficiency is the same as that
                  calculated for the Lorentz model collision operator.}
