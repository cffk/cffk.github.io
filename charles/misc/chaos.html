<p>Swirl in a spoonful of cream and that friendly cup of morning coffee
turns into a chaotic realm of collisions and disorder resembling the
erratic behavior of ions in a magnetic plasma field.

<p>Of course it helps to see that resemblance if a physicist does the
swirling.

<p>Charles Karney sees the chaos in both coffee and plasma fields.  He
also sees it in the breeding patterns of insects and behavior of
computerized billiard balls.

<p>A theoretical physicist at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
since 1977.  Dr. Karney studies &ldquo;chaos,&rdquo; the growing science
of unpredictability.

<p>&ldquo;That's a very important piece of physics which explains why,
when you swirl milk in coffee, the milk doesn't stay all
together.&rdquo; Dr. Karney said.

<p>The spoon and the swirling action disturb the milk molecules.  Up to
that point they had been held together.  Add that disturbance,
Dr. Karney explained, and the milk flies apart randomly and violently
&mdash; for milk, that is.

<p>The same action results when a swift-running stream encounters a
rock.  The water swirls, jumps and dances in anything but predictable
ways, said Dr. Karney, who will bring his descriptions and computer
animations to the Science on Saturday Lecture series at the lab this
week.

<p>Chaos &mdash; first predicted by mathematicians in the early 18th
century &mdash; disrupts the traditional attempts of scientists to
predict and control the world, Dr. Karney said.

<p>Scientists now can detail and model intricate systems &ldquo;that you
can tell almost by looking at them, they will turn chaotic.&rdquo; the
Prospect Avenue, Princeton Township, resident said.

<p>In a chaotic system like the coffee mug, researchers cannot predict
how a particular drop of milk will behave.

<p>&ldquo;You wind up trying to say things about the system.&rdquo;
Dr. Karney said.  &ldquo;You don't try to say where every atom inside a
gas goes.&rdquo;

<p>But to predict that average behavior, researchers like Dr. Karney who
are trying to model the super-heated plasma that creates nuclear fusion
need to understand the system and its quirks as best they can.

<p>And that leads Dr. Karney to his colorful computer models &mdash;
maps of chaos that look like abstract art of the next century.

<p>&ldquo;People have a tendency to understand what they can
illustrate.&rdquo; said Dr. Karney, who professes a fondness for his
Macintosh.

<p>&ldquo;But pretty pictures often tell you where to go.  They don't
tell you how to solve a problem; rather they tell where to look for the
problem.&rdquo; he said.

<p>Dr. Karney pointed to a map of swirling ellipses.  It could have been
a map of the great storms on Jupiter.  It was the paths of ions inside
that magnetic field, he said.

<p>The ellipses point to order.  The jangly lines that look like the
marks of tree branches on a frosted window pane point to disorder in the
system.

<p>&ldquo;You have to know what kinds of questions to ask.&rdquo;
Dr. Karney said.  &ldquo;In research they just tell you to solve a
problem.  Half of it is coming up with the questions to ask to find the
answers you need.&rdquo;

<h2>Saturday sessions put flare in physics</h2>
<h3>Hoping to lure youngsters to science</h3>

<p>PLAINSBORO &mdash; It started eight years ago &mdash; the byproduct of a
group of physicists and a bull session at the Princeton Plasma Physics
Laboratory.

<p>Now their attempts to draw youngsters to science draw capacity crowds
each Saturday from January through March.

<p>&ldquo;When it first started eight years ago, we were not sure how
many people would come out.&rdquo; said PPPL's Anthony DeMeo.

<p>&ldquo;We would have 60 or 65 people,&rdquo; he said.

<p>&ldquo;Now we've got 350 people on a regular basis.  We have to set
up closed-circuit TV so we can handle the overflow crowds.&rdquo;
Mr. DeMeo said.

<p>Science on Saturdays is one program in the laboratory's science
outreach efforts.  Faculty, researchers and engineers speak regularly at
area high schools about the facility's attempts to create fusion energy
and about the challenges of science and engineering.

<p>The laboratory now runs a partnership with the Trenton School
District to foster science interest and education, Mr. DeMeo said.

<p>&ldquo;It's all part of the overall program,&rdquo; he said.

<p>Science on Saturday started with conversations among the laboratory's
staff, Mr. DeMeo explained.

<p>&ldquo;They were recalling lectures that they attended when they were
young.  Many of them said that experience was something that excited
them in science and in pursuing science.&rdquo; Mr. DeMeo said.
&ldquo;We tried to recreate some of that for the kids, the parents and
teachers.&rdquo;

<p>The lectures and demonstrations are designed to be anything but
routine and dull.

<p>Topics swing from the role of the brain's pleasure centers in drug
abuse to technology that sends pictures and sounds with laser beams.
Dinosaurs were also on this year's agenda.

<p>One lecturer will discuss what is in the universe while another will
tell students how to find what is out there themselves.

<p>On Saturday at 9:30 a.m., Charles Karney is scheduled to present a
&ldquo;tour of chaos,&rdquo; the science of finding predictability and
order in the unpredictable world of nature.

<p>Ruth Daly will end the program with her presentation on the evolution
of galaxies in the universe.

<p>Each week during the program, PPPL has offered a leading expert
discussing new technologies and developments in language that informs
and excites kids, Mr. DeMeo said.

<p>&ldquo;One of the things that's made this a success is we really have
been able to attract the top people.&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;And that's
made it exciting for everybody.&rdquo;
