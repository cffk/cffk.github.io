  abstract =     {A weakly relativistic theory of current drive by
                  parallel acceleration of electrons in toroidal
                  geometry is presented.  Analytic expressions of
                  efficiency are obtained for superthermal and
                  subthermal electrons.  By using a few adjustable
                  parameters for intermediate energies, an accurate
                  formula for the efficiency is obtained by fitting
                  numerical results.  This includes trapping effects and
                  is valid for all frequencies up to the lower hybrid
                  range of frequencies.  It is found that for
                  low-frequency fast-wave current drive, the
                  relativistic and nonrelativistic efficiencies agree to
                  within 15\% up to 500 keV, although the relativistic
                  corrections to power absorption and current density
                  can be much larger separately.  Relativistic effects
                  on the efficiency become prominent at lower energies
                  for Landau damping.}
