  abstract =     {The phase space for Hamiltonians of two degrees of
                  freedom is usually divided into stochastic and
                  integrable components.  Even when well into the
                  stochastic regime, integrable orbits may surround
                  small stable regions or islands.  The effect of these
                  islands on the correlation function for the stochastic
                  trajectories is examined.  Depending on the value of
                  the parameter describing the rotation number for the
                  elliptic fixed point at the center of the island, the
                  long-time correlation function may decay as
                  &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;5&lt;/sup&gt; or exponentially,
                  but more commonly it decays much more slowly (roughly
                  as &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;).  As a
                  consequence these small islands may have a profound
                  effect on the properties of the stochastic orbits.  In
                  particular, there is evidence that the evolution of a
                  distribution of particles is no longer governed by a
                  diffusion equation.}
