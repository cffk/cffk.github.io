  oabstract =    {The circuit equations for current drive in a start-up
                  or ramp-up plasma are derived by the finding of
                  appropriate response functions in the presence of an

                  rather remarkable PLT ramp-up efficiencies, difficult
                  to explain using the steady-state efficiency, is now
                  possible.  A parameter regime, available also on
                  reactor-grade devices, is identified wherein quick
                  ramp-up by lower-hybrid waves may be efficient.}
