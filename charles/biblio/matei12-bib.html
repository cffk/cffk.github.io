  abstract =     {A method for extracting a 3D terrain model for
                  identifying at least buildings and terrain from LIDAR
                  data is disclosed, comprising the steps of generating
                  a point cloud representing terrain and buildings
                  mapped by LIDAR; classifying points in the point
                  cloud, the point cloud having ground and non-ground
                  points, the non-ground points representing buildings
                  and clutter; segmenting the non-ground points into
                  buildings and clutter; and calculating a fit between
                  at least one building segment and at least one
                  rectilinear structure, wherein the fit yields the
                  rectilinear structure with the fewest number of
                  vertices.  The step of calculating further comprises
                  the steps of (a) calculating a fit of a rectilinear
                  structure to the at least one building segment,
                  wherein each of the vertices has an angle that is a
                  multiple of 90 degrees; (b) counting the number of
                  vertices; (c) rotating the at least one building
                  segment about an axis by a predetermined increment;
                  and (d) repeating steps (a)&amp;ndash;(c) until a
                  rectilinear structure with the least number of
                  vertices is found.}
