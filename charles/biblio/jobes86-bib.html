  abstract =     {Lower hybrid waves have been used on the PLT tokamak
                  both to start the plasma current and to ramp it up
                  from pre-existing levels.  The waves, at 800 MHz, were
                  launched from a 6-waveguide grill.  The phasing
                  between adjacent guides could be selected
                  electronically, and thus the launched spectrum could
                  be set and changed at will.  For start-up, the
                  waveguide phase difference was initially set at 0&amp;deg;
                  in order to create a plasma, then switched to 90&amp;deg;
                  to drive the current.  Over 100 kA of plasma current,
                  at a density of 0.5&amp;ndash;1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;
                  cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;, was generated in this manner.
                  Ramp-up experiments were performed under a wide
                  variety of conditions.  The most efficient ramp-up was
                  found at the lowest plasma densities and with the
                  fastest launched spectrum (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
                  &amp;sim; 2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;,
                  N&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;sim; 1.6 peak); &amp;sim; 20\% of the
                  launched RF power was converted to (increased)
                  poloidal field energy.  All of the ramp-up results are
                  in excellent agreement with a theory which determines
                  the efficiency of ramp-up from the consideration of
                  the relative energy losses of the superthermal
                  current-carrying electrons to collisions and to the
                  opposing inductive &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-field.}
