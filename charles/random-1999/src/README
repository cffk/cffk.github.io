The library routines are in

    random.f         -- uniform random numbers
    randother.f      -- gaussian numbers, isotropic, and cosine vectors

random.f can be used by itself.  randother.f requires random.f.

These files are suitable for all machines for which double precision is
required to get 64-bit long real numbers.

On the Crays and other machines where real floating points number are
represented by 64 bits, you should instead use

    random-hiprec.f
    randother-hiprec.f

The include file is

    random.h

On some platforms, significantly faster performance can be obtained by
changing (in random.f)

      something=tmp-int(tmp)

to the equivalent (because 0<=tmp<2)

      if(tmp.GE.1.0d0)then
        something=tmp-1.0d0
      else
        something=tmp
      end if

This appears to speed up random on SGI and Linux platforms.
