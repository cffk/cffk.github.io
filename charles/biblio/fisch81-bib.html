  abstract =     {Various types of traveling waves may be injected into
                  a tokamak to continuously sustain the toroidal
                  current.  Interest in this problem arises from the
                  possibility of operating tokamak reactors in the
                  steady state.  The low-frequency waves most suitable
                  for this task are identified in terms of the power
                  cost for deployment in a reactor.  Means of exciting
                  these waves and tradeoffs with design criteria are
                  discussed.  A comparison is made with the alternative
                  attractive regime of high-frequency waves.
                  Conclusions are based, in part, on the numerical
                  solution of the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation
                  with an added quasi-linear term due to the waves.}
