  abstract =     {The propagation of lower hybrid waves in the presence
                  of ponderomotive density fluctuations is considered.
                  The problem is treated in two dimensions and, in order
                  to be able to correctly impose the boundary
                  conditions, the waves are allowed to evolve in time.
                  The fields are described by
                  &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;tau;&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; &amp;int;
                  &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&amp;zeta; +
                  &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;zeta;&amp;zeta;&lt;/sub&gt; +
                  |&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt; = 0 where &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt; is
                  proportional to the electric field, &amp;tau; to time, and
                  &amp;zeta; and &amp;xi; measure distances across and along the
                  lower hybrid ray.  The behavior of the waves is
                  investigated numerically.  If the amplitude of the
                  waves is large enough, the spectrum of the waves
                  broadens and their parallel wavelength becomes
                  shorter.  The assumptions made in the formulation
                  preclude the application of these results to the lower
                  hybrid heating experiment on Alcator&amp;ndash;A.
                  Nevertheless, there are indications that the physics
                  embodied in this problem are responsible for some of
                  the results of that experiment.}
