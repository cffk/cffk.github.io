  abstract =     {Current drive by fast waves (FWCD) is an important
                  candidate for steady-state operation of tokamaks.
                  Major experiments using this scheme are being carried
                  out on DIII-D.  There has been considerable study of
                  the theoretical efficiency of
                  FWCD.&lt;sup&gt;1&amp;ndash;7&lt;/sup&gt; In Refs.  4 and 5, the
                  nonrelativistic efficiency of FWCD at arbitrary
                  frequencies was studied.  For DIII-D parameters, the
                  results can be considerably different from the Laudau
                  and Alfv&amp;eacute;n limits.  At the high temperatures of
                  reactors and DIII-D upgrade, relativistic effects
                  become important.  In this paper, the relativistic
                  FWCD efficiency for arbitrary frequencies is studied.
                  Assuming that the plasma is weakly relativistic, i.e.,
                  &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;mc&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is small,
                  an analytic expression for FWCD is obtained for high
                  resonant energies
                  (&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
                  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1).  Comparisons with the results from a
                  numerical code ADJ&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; and the nonrelativistic
                  results&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; shall be made and analytical fits
                  in the whole range of velocities shall be presented.}
