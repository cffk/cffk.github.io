  abstract =     {The equations describing the nonlinear propagation of
                  waves in an anisotropic plasma are rarely exactly
                  soluble.  However it is often possible to make
                  approximations that reduce the exact equations into a
                  simple equation.  In this paper we will describe how
                  MACSYMA may be used to make such approximations, and
                  so reduce the equation describing lower hybrid waves
                  into the nonlinear Schr&amp;ouml;dinger equation which is
                  soluble by the inverse scattering method.  It should
                  be pointed out here that we have not used MACSYMA to
                  do the whole problem; rather MACSYMA is used at
                  several stages in the calculation that are otherwise
                  done by hand.  This is not to say that MACSYMA could
                  not do the whole problem, just that there is a natural
                  division between calculations what are easiest done by
                  hand, and those that are easiest done by machine.}
