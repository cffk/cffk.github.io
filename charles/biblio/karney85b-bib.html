  abstract =     {The theory of rf-driven plasma currents is applied to
                  the lower-hybrid experiments on the Princeton Large
                  Torus tokamak.  Particular emphasis is placed on those
                  experiments in which the plasma current was varying.
                  The comparison between theory and experiment is made
                  with respect to the efficiency with which rf energy
                  was converted to poloidal magnetic field energy.  Good
                  agreement is found irrespective of whether the current
                  was increasing, constant, or decreasing.}
