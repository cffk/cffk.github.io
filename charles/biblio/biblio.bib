		  lower hybrid frequency is examined.  The ion waves
		  considered are ion acoustic, electrostatic ion
		  cyclotron and magnetosonic waves.  The approach
		  adopted is coupling of modes carried out to second
		  order.  We examine the effects of varying the angles
		  of the excited waves, and apply the results to
		  excitation of such waves in a bounded inhomogeneous
		  plasma.  The plasma is assumed uniform and is
		  described by the two fluid equations.	 Considerable
		  complexity is introduced by taking the angles of
		  propagation to be arbitrary (subject to frequency and
		  wave number matching conditions), and by taking the
		  magnetic field to be finite.	In order to treat this
		  problem analytically, we have made extensive use of
		  MACSYMA, a large symbolic computation system, that has
		  been developed by the Mathlab group at M.I.T.	 Using
		  this facility we have been able to obtain approximate
		  analytic results for the growth rates of the excited
		  waves.  Using damping rates from kinetic theory,
		  thresholds for these interactions have been
		  calculated, for typical tokamak plasmas.  With the
		  interaction in a uniform plasma well understood, we
		  have tried to examine some of the effects of exciting
		  the pump from a waveguide at the wall of an
		  inhomogeneous plasma.	 We find that in tokamak plasmas
		  it is possible to excite electrostatic ion cyclotron
		  waves, but since the pump ray is very narrow unstable
		  pulses are unable to grow significantly before
		  convecting out of the pump region.  However if it is
		  possible to set up an array of waveguides at the
		  boundary of the plasma, a larger region of pump fields
		  is attainable, and strong excitation of the
		  electrostatic ion cyclotron wave should take place
		  with reasonable external rf powers.}

		  waves excited by RF power near the lower hybrid

		  to evaluate such an interaction as a method of heating
		  the ions in a tokamak.  The problem is simplified by
		  assuming the magnetic field, <i>B</i><sub>0</sub>, to
		  be uniform and the lower hybrid wave (whose frequency,
		  &omega;, is much greater than the ion cyclotron
		  frequency, &Omega;<sub><i>i</i></sub>&nbsp;) to be

		  The stochasticity condition is independent of how

  abstract =	 {It is widely recognized that a key element in he
		  development of an attractive tokamak reactor, and in
		  the successful achievement of the mission of ITER, is
		  the development of an efficient steady-state current
		  drive technique.  Fast waves in the ion cyclotron
		  range of frequencies hold the promise to drive
		  steady-state currents with the required efficiency and
		  to effectively heat the plasma to ignition.
		  Advantages over other heating and current drive
		  techniques include low cost per watt and the ability
		  to penetrate to the center of high-density plasmas.
		  The primary issues that must be resolved are:<br>
		  1. Can an antenna be designed to radiate the required
		  spectrum of waves and have adequate coupling
		  properties?<br> 2. Will the RF power be efficiently
		  absorbed by electrons in the desired velocity range
		  without unacceptable parasitic damping by fuel ions or
		  &alpha; particles?<br> 3. What will the efficiency of
		  current drive be when toroidal effects such as trapped
		  particles are included?<br> 4. Can a practical RF
		  system be designed and integrated into the device?<br>
		  We have addressed these issues by performing extensive
		  calculations with ORION, a 2-D code, and the ray
		  tracing code RAYS, which calculates wave propagation,
		  absorption and current drive in tokamak geometry, and
		  with RIP, a 2-D code that self-consistently calculates
		  current drive and MHD equilibrium.  An important
		  figure of merit in this context is the integrated,
		  normalized current drive efficiency, &gamma; =
		  (<i>n</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>&nbsp;/10<sup>20</sup>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>)<i>I</i><sub>RF</sub>(<i>R</i>/<i>P</i><sub>RF</sub>),
		  where <i>n</i><sub><i>e</i></sub> is the average
		  electron density, <i>I</i><sub>RF</sub> is the total
		  RF driven current, and <i>P</i><sub>RF</sub>is the RF
		  power required.  The calculations that we present here
		  emphasize the ITER device.  We consider (1) a
		  low-frequency scenario (<i>f</i> &sim; 17 MHz) such
		  that no ion resonances appear in the machine, and (2)
		  a high-frequency scenario (<i>f</i> &sim; 51&ndash;59
		  MHz) such that the deuterium second harmonic resonance
		  is just outside the plasma and the tritium second
		  harmonic is in the plasma, midway between the magnetic
		  axis and the inside edge.  In both cases electron
		  currents are driven by combined TTMP and Landau
		  damping of the fast waves.  We find that fast waves
		  are quite competitive with other current drive
		  techniques.}

		  constraints on the operation of the divertor are that
		  it should not result in a large flux of impurities
		  into the plasma and that the divertor plate should not
		  erode too quickly. In order to satisfy the last
		  constraint, it is necessary to reduce the temperature
		  of the plasma striking the plate to far below the
		  temperature at the last closed flux surface; otherwise
		  the erosion rate in quasi-steady operation for a
		  machine such as ITER is meters per year.<br> Neutrals
		  play a pivotal role in the divertor.	In the steady

		  addition, in a &ldquo;high-recycling&rdquo; divertor a
		  given ion strikes the divertor plate, is neutralized,
		  flows back towards the plasma, is ionized, and swept
		  back to the divertor plate hundreds of times before
		  the particle is pumped away.	This results in a high
		  neutral density and a lower temperature in front of
		  the divertor plate.  Other ways of reducing the

		  in the &ldquo;gas target&rdquo; divertor, the plasma
		  flows into a gas cell and a high-<i>Z</i> element
		  radiates away much of the power.  In such a divertor,
		  neutrals also play a central role.<br> In order to

		  the plasma and the neutrals, the various reactions
		  between them (ionization, recombination, charge
		  exchange, dissociation, etc.), and their interaction
		  with the divertor plate and other material
		  surfaces.<br> In this paper, I address the issue of
		  modeling the transport of the neutrals.  The goals of
		  such modeling are to provide reliable measures of the
		  neutral transport in a divertor for coupling to a
		  plasma code, the evaluation of erosion rates,
		  impurities influx, etc., and the evaluation of

		  and clutter; segmenting the non-ground points into
		  buildings and clutter; and calculating a fit between
		  at least one building segment and at least one
		  rectilinear structure, wherein the fit yields the
		  rectilinear structure with the fewest number of
		  vertices.  The step of calculating further comprises
		  the steps of (a) calculating a fit of a rectilinear
		  structure to the at least one building segment,
		  wherein each of the vertices has an angle that is a
		  multiple of 90 degrees; (b) counting the number of
		  vertices; (c) rotating the at least one building
		  segment about an axis by a predetermined increment;
		  and (d) repeating steps (a)&ndash;(c) until a
		  rectilinear structure with the least number of
		  vertices is found.}

  abstract =	 {An algorithm for sampling exactly from the normal
		  distribution is given.  The algorithm reads some
		  number of uniformly distributed random digits in a
		  given base and generates an initial portion of the
		  representation of a normal deviate in the same base.
		  Thereafter, uniform random digits are copied directly
		  into the representation of the normal deviate.  Thus,
		  in contrast to existing methods, it is possible to
		  generate normal deviates exactly rounded to any
		  precision with a mean cost that scales linearly in the
		  precision.  The method performs no arbitrary precision
		  arithmetic, calls no transcendental functions, and,
		  indeed, uses no floating point arithmetic whatsoever;
		  it uses only simple integer operations.  The algorithm
		  is inspired by von Neumann's algorithm for sampling
		  from the exponential distribution; an improvement to
		  von Neumann's algorithm is also given.}
