  abstract =     {It is shown that a distribution of electrons in
                  resonance with traveling waves, but colliding with
                  background distributions of electrons and ions,
                  evolves to a steady state.  Previously, the existence
                  of such solutions had been assumed, but not proved, in
                  numerical and other calculations.  Details of the
                  steady state are given analytically in the asymptotic
                  limit of high electron energy and are compared with
                  numerical solutions.  The asymptotic analytic solution
                  may be useful for quickly relating emission data to
                  likely excitations and is more reliable than
                  conventional numerical solutions at high energy.  A
                  method of improving numerics at high energy is
                  suggested.}
