  abstract =     {In recent years, there has been considerable interest
                  in understanding the motion in Hamiltonian systems
                  when phase space is divided into stochastic and
                  integrable regions.  This paper studies one aspect of
                  this problem, namely, the motion of trajectories in
                  the stochastic sea when there is a small island
                  present.  The results show that the particle can be
                  stuck close to the island for very long times.  For
                  the standard mapping, where accelerator modes are
                  possible, it appears that the mean squared
                  displacement of particles in the stochastic sea may
                  increase faster than linearly with time indicating
                  non-diffusive behavior.}
