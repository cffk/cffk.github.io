<strong>Abstract</strong>
<blockquote>
Fast wave current drive (FWCD) is a principal candidate for non-inductive current drive schemes in reactors. Major experiments are in progress or planned on DIII-D, JET, and Tore-Supra. A theory for FWCD was presented by two of the authors and collaborators. To minimize computations required in transport simulations, and for analytical understanding, it is very useful to have a concise analytical efficiency formula. Fisch and Karney, and Ehst and Karney have obtained empirical formulae that fit numerical results for the Landau limit and Alfv&eacute;n limit (low frequency limit); the latter fits results at 1 &lt; <i>Z</i><sub><small>i</small></sub> &le; 2. This paper extends a previous numerical study on FWCD at arbitrary frequencies and <i>Z</i><sub><small>i</small></sub>. Analytical formulae for FWCD efficiency, valid for all frequencies and <i>Z</i><sub><small>i</small></sub>, are derived using the adjoint technique in high and low phase velocity regions. A smooth patching between the two regimes produces an analytical formula which is accurate for all frequencies, <i>Z</i><sub><small>i</small></sub>, and phase velocities. Comparison with existing results will be discussed. A corollary of the present calculation is that at low phase velocities and in the Landau limit, the efficiency is the same as that calculated for the Lorentz model collision operator.
