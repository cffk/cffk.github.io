  abstract =     {By injecting radio-frequency traveling waves into a
                  tokamak, continuous toroidal electron currents may be
                  generated.  This process is studied by numerically
                  solving the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation
                  with an added quasi-linear term.  The results are
                  compared with the one-dimensional analytic treatment
                  of Fisch, which predicted a reduced plasma resistivity
                  when high-phase-velocity waves are employed.  It is
                  shown that two-dimensional velocity space effects,
                  while retaining the predicted scaling, further reduce
                  the ratio of power dissipated to current generated by
                  about 40\%.  These effects enhance the attractiveness
                  of steady-state tokamak reactors utilizing this method
                  of current generation.}
