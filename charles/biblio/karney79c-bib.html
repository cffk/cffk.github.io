                  sequence of frequencies with finite damping decrements
                  resulting from the Alfv&amp;eacute;n resonance.  The
                  finite-frequency effects can cause the damping to
                  almost vanish.  This permits Alfv&amp;eacute;n resonance

                  permits the fast Alfv&amp;eacute;n mode.  The finite

                  resulting from the shear Alfv&amp;eacute;n resonance.
                  With appropriate choice of parameters, the dissipation
                  can vanish allowing high-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; toroidal eigenmodes
                  in large tokamaks such as PLT.}
