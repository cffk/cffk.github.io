  abstract =     {We are developing a code to solve the time-dependent
                  Fokker-Planck equation for a high temperature
                  magnetized plasma, including the full collision
                  operator, quasi-linear wave-plasma interaction, and an
                  electric field term.  For the solution of the
                  equations the multigrid method is employed, making the
                  code cheap in terms of cpu-time and memory.  In its
                  initial version our code is suitable to study some
                  basic problems in which all species except one are
                  assumed Maxwellian.  Examples are the runaway problem,
                  and rf heating and current drive by electron cyclotron
                  or lower hybrid waves.  Another class of fundamental
                  studies that we intend to undertake involves the
                  determination of linear response functions for various
                  moments of the distribution function via the adjoint
                  method.  Moments of interest include the current and
                  the parallel and perpendicular energy.  In particular
                  we are interested in studying the response function
                  for synchrotron radiation for the purpose of
                  experimental determination of the electron
                  distribution function and the rf energy deposition
                  profile.}
