<strong>Abstract</strong>
<blockquote>
The divertor is one of the critical components in a tokamak reactor. It must absorb the &alpha;-particle power and particle flux and any auxiliary heating power; it must permit the removal of the helium ash so that the hydrogen fuel in not diluted. The major constraints on the operation of the divertor are that it should not result in a large flux of impurities into the plasma and that the divertor plate should not erode too quickly. In order to satisfy the last constraint, it is necessary to reduce the temperature of the plasma striking the plate to far below the temperature at the last closed flux surface; otherwise the erosion rate in quasi-steady operation for a machine such as ITER is meters per year.<br> Neutrals play a pivotal role in the divertor. In the steady state, the flux of ions onto the plate is approximately balanced by an outflow of neutrals. In addition, in a &ldquo;high-recycling&rdquo; divertor a given ion strikes the divertor plate, is neutralized, flows back towards the plasma, is ionized, and swept back to the divertor plate hundreds of times before the particle is pumped away. This results in a high neutral density and a lower temperature in front of the divertor plate. Other ways of reducing the erosion rate are also being investigated: for example, in the &ldquo;gas target&rdquo; divertor, the plasma flows into a gas cell and a high-<i>Z</i> element radiates away much of the power. In such a divertor, neutrals also play a central role.<br> In order to model a divertor it is therefore necessary to describe the plasma and the neutrals, the various reactions between them (ionization, recombination, charge exchange, dissociation, etc.), and their interaction with the divertor plate and other material surfaces.<br> In this paper, I address the issue of modeling the transport of the neutrals. The goals of such modeling are to provide reliable measures of the neutral transport in a divertor for coupling to a plasma code, the evaluation of erosion rates, impurities influx, etc., and the evaluation of diagnostic quantities, e.g., the line integrated radiation, for calibration against experimental measurements.
