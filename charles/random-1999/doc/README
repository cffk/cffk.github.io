This is the documentation for the random library in DVI, PostScript, and
PDF format.  All versions of the files have the same content.

These files are produced from the FWEB source code which is part of the
degas2 distribution.  I have not included this FWEB code here since it
requires your having the FWEB system to use it and because it depends on
serveral other header files which are part of the degas2 programming
environment.  Ask, if you would like to have these FWEB files.
