<h3>ssh as an &ldquo;inconvenient authentication&rdquo; mechanism</h3>
Note: The <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu">SRP</a> web site no longer
contains the remarks complained about here and instead provides a more
even-handed
<a href="http://srp.stanford.edu/analysis.html">comparison</a>.
The link provided below uses the
<a href="http://www.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> (from 1998-01-18).
However, this E-mail is still relevant in that it raises the issue that
security software needs to be used before it can be effective.

The Web blurb about <a href="http://srp.stanford.edu">SRP</a> includes this (from
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19980118154114/http://srp.stanford.edu/srp/history.html#inconvenient">http://srp.stanford.edu/srp/history.html#inconvenient</a>)

    INCONVENIENT AUTHENTICATION
    ...
    SSH

    ... To negotiate a partially secure file transfer, for example, a user
    must remember to do:

    $ ssh -L 1234:remote-server.stanford.edu:21 remote-server
    (in a different window)
    $ ftp myhost 1234

    instead of the customary 

    $ ftp remote-server

    Not surprisingly, ssh is regarded as "power-user" software by most
    ordinary users.

Since few people actually use ssh in this way, perhaps this example
should be replaced by

    ... To transfer files securely, for example, a user does:

    $ scp files remote-server.stanford.edu:remote-directory/

    instead of the customary 

    $ rcp files remote-server.stanford.edu:remote-directory/

    except that scp will nicely prompt for a password if access is not
    granted via ~/.rhosts.  Not surprisingly, ssh is quite easy for
    ordinary users.

or better still:

    ... To log into a remote host while providing both access to both
    AFS and to his X server, a user does

    $ ssh remote-host
    Password:

    instead of the customary

    $ xauth list $DISPLAY
    x-server:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 zrandom-cookie
    $ telnet remote-host
    Password:
    $ export DISPLAY=x-server:0.0
    $ xauth add x-server:0 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 random-cookie
    $ klog
    Password:

    Not surprisingly, ordinary users are very happy to start using
    ssh.

I appreciate the point being made about ssh, namely that users have to
learn some new commands to use ssh, especially if they want to take
advantage of some of its attractive features (e.g., agent forwarding
so that the pass-phrase need only be given once per "session").

As I see it there are (at least) two impediments to the wide
deployment of secure communication protocols on the Internet: (a) user
inertia (the point made by SRP's author) and (b) the need to
interoperate with an existing body of hardware and software.

ssh shines on the second point.  No existing programs or files need to
be changed.  ssh just provides an alternative secure connection method.

srp on the other hand is likely to be difficult to deploy in many
cases.  For example, we use NIS to provide a common password database.
srp doesn't currently support this, nor any other method of
distributed management of accounts.

Also our users currently expect not to have to type their passwords
more than once a day, even though they may be logging into a score of
computers.  Here again ssh provides a workable solution.

I'm not intending to knock srp--it has some very attractive features.
It's just that I find the comparisons with other authentication
methods (in particular with ssh) a little unbalanced.

I think it would be worthwhile to implement srp in ssh.  Also, it's
possible that ssh could be used to implement a reasonable scheme for
the distribution of srp passwords.
