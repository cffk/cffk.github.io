  abstract =     {It is widely recognized that a key element in he
                  development of an attractive tokamak reactor, and in
                  the successful achievement of the mission of ITER, is
                  the development of an efficient steady-state current
                  drive technique.  Fast waves in the ion cyclotron
                  range of frequencies hold the promise to drive
                  steady-state currents with the required efficiency and
                  to effectively heat the plasma to ignition.
                  Advantages over other heating and current drive
                  techniques include low cost per watt and the ability
                  to penetrate to the center of high-density plasmas.
                  The primary issues that must be resolved are:&lt;br&gt;
                  1. Can an antenna be designed to radiate the required
                  spectrum of waves and have adequate coupling
                  properties?&lt;br&gt; 2. Will the RF power be efficiently
                  absorbed by electrons in the desired velocity range
                  without unacceptable parasitic damping by fuel ions or
                  &amp;alpha; particles?&lt;br&gt; 3. What will the efficiency of
                  current drive be when toroidal effects such as trapped
                  particles are included?&lt;br&gt; 4. Can a practical RF
                  system be designed and integrated into the device?&lt;br&gt;
                  We have addressed these issues by performing extensive
                  calculations with ORION, a 2-D code, and the ray
                  tracing code RAYS, which calculates wave propagation,
                  absorption and current drive in tokamak geometry, and
                  with RIP, a 2-D code that self-consistently calculates
                  current drive and MHD equilibrium.  An important
                  figure of merit in this context is the integrated,
                  normalized current drive efficiency, &amp;gamma; =
                  (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;/10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;RF&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;RF&lt;/sub&gt;),
                  where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the average
                  electron density, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;RF&lt;/sub&gt; is the total
                  RF driven current, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;RF&lt;/sub&gt;is the RF
                  power required.  The calculations that we present here
                  emphasize the ITER device.  We consider (1) a
                  low-frequency scenario (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; &amp;sim; 17 MHz) such
                  that no ion resonances appear in the machine, and (2)
                  a high-frequency scenario (&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt; &amp;sim; 51&amp;ndash;59
                  MHz) such that the deuterium second harmonic resonance
                  is just outside the plasma and the tritium second
                  harmonic is in the plasma, midway between the magnetic
                  axis and the inside edge.  In both cases electron
                  currents are driven by combined TTMP and Landau
                  damping of the fast waves.  We find that fast waves
                  are quite competitive with other current drive
                  techniques.}
